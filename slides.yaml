      vowel -> even
    notes: |
      You are shown a set of four cards placed on a table, each of which has a
      number on one side and a letter on the other side.
      Here's my claim:
      If a card has a vowel on one side, it has an even number on the other
      Which cards must you turn over to prove my claim?

    notes: |
      Four more cards - each card is a person.
      Now the rule is: you have to be 21 to drink.
      Which cards do you need to flip?

    notes: |
      Illustrates a point - we're good at figuring out who to trust, but not at
      figuring out logics
      And on the internet we have to use the logics to figure out trust

      Minimize Trust
    notes: |
      The purpose of crypto is to minimize the amount of trust required between actors
      and the number of people that need to be trusted
